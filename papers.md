Remote Sensing, Inference, and Intelligence in the Information Environment

Thomas Galligani Master's Thesis
	Russian disinformation campaign in 2016 sparked need to handle adversarial actions in information environments.
	Introduces:
		Model of online "information environment"
		Framework for combining sensing, aggregation, and analysis
		Dataset of Twitter data regarding discussions of 
			I like that the control was Kobe Bryant - lots of discussion, but little motivation for "adversarial" action (except maybe conspiracy theorists)
		Sensor for information environment (really good statistically)
	Scientific inquiry (sensor) <---> observational inquiry (collect observations) <---> intelligence inquiry (analysis of observations)
	Technology mediates modern information environment. See model.
		Relevant to me because it doesn't just apply to social information. Also similar to how attackers AND defenders process information.
	

	Sensor Design:
		Start with a corpus of timestamped online posts
	NOTATION FOR SENSOR
		Actor n - active user/user group/other entity within social media
		Action m - Some metadata characteristic (did they mention a campaign slogan? Did they post at a certain time? Etc.)
		Partition i - logical grouping of users into a group based on some characteristic.
			Different partitions indicate different communities whose information we want to compare
			A set of n makes up a set of i
		Trustworthy = referencing a cited source
		Untrustworthy = referencing an untrustworthy news source
		Equation to find out how certain actions stem from certain untrustworthy sources
