## *MEETING 0*

- Find reading at ``https://scirate.com/arxiv/quant-ph``
- ``https://scirate.com/arxiv/2501.07625``
	- If it's one qubit, can extract. (??)
- Working on problem of "position verification" this quarter 

## *MEETING 1*

- Terms to look up
	- CHSH
	- "Unconditional proof"
	- EPR pair
	- Game theory in quantum applications
	- Notation of |b>, |x>, etc.
- General notes from people speaking
	- use multiple bits of entanglement (?)
- Proof of quantumness!
	- Review of what a POQ is
	- A simple template for PoQ
- What is a PoQ?
	- A game a classical verifier V plays with unknown prover P such that:
		- P can convince V that it's quantum
		- No classical prover can convince V that it's quantum
	- If A + B share an EPR pair and Alice makes any measurement, then Alice and Bob's resulting states will be the same.
	- Examples
		- Factoring
			- Think Shor's algorithm - makes quantum easy, but classical hard
		- Random quantum circuit
			- Send P quantum circuit, ask P to send back the result
		- CHSH game
			- Unconditional proof of quantumness with two noncommunicative provers
				- Not ideal - we want a game with one prover
				- Unconditional proof means ...
			- Ex. 
				- V samples two random bits u and v - one as a question for for Alice A and one for Bob B
			 	- Each provides a bit answer a and b
				- Accept if ``u /\ v = a XOR b``
			- Best classical strategy has a winning strategy of 3/4
			- Quantum strategy does better - $frac{(cos(\pi)}{8})^2$
			- A + B share EPR pair
				- A -> u=0: std basis, u=1: H-basis
				- B -> v=0: $frac{\pi}{8}$ basis, v=1: $-frac{\pi}{8}$ basis
		- Cryptographic
			- Use cryptography to attain efficient verification
			- Conditioned on the underlying cryptography game
- Simple template for PoQ
	- Notes
		- If the system is quantum, the only way to break encryption is to perform H-basis measurement
		- More or less a modified version of the CHSH game
		- P does most of the heavy lifting in the first round with the encrypted measurement
	- V chooses bit u {0,1}, encrypts, and sends to P
	- P performs "encrypted Hadamard-basis measurement", sends back d
		- ``u=0: onetimepad(|0>)`` in set ``{|0>, |1>}``
		- ``u=1: onetimepad(|+> or |->)`` in set ``{|+>, |->}``
		- (Honest prover's interactions)
	- V determines a using d
	- V prepares and sends v to B
	- Bob does usual strategy, sends back b
	- P accepts if ``u /\ v = a XOR b``
- Instantiation of PoQ
	- Use dual-mode trapdoor functions
		- Get two functions $f_0, f_1$ along with a trapdoor function x. $y_0, y_1: x -> y$ are injective
		- Mode 0: $f_0, f_1 are disjoint images$
		- Mode 1: $f_0, f_1 are same image$
		- Two modes should be computationally indistinguishable in order to maintain the "dual-mode" property
		- Trapdoor allows us to invert functions: $x_i = f_i^{-1}(y,t))$
	- Example of usage
		- V generates u {0,1}
		- V instantiates a pair of trapdoor functions $f_0, f_1$ from u, sends them over to P
		- P computes on enc(u) using functions.
			- if u=1, in mode 1. 
				- ``|0>|x_0> + |1>|x_1>``
				- $H^n$ on second register
				- I give up on writing this down (lol)
