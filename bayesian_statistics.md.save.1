- Thinking about how science influences statistics (an applied form of mathematics)
- Bayesian inference vs. frequentism is a common debate in stats courses
	- Won't discuss it though. Looking at causal inference instead. Bayesian debate is mostly settled
		- Science before statistics.
		- For statistical models to produce scientific insight, they require additional scientific (causal) models where changing a var changes another
		- The reasons for a statistical analysis are not found in the data but in the causes of the data. Numbers mean nothing without context.
			- Data cannot be extracted from causes alone (requires testing.) Likewise, causes cannot be extracted from data alone. No causes in; no causes out.
		- What is causal inference?
			- More of an association between variables
			- "Causal inference" is prediction of intervention
				- Knowing a cause means being able to predict the consequence s of an intervention by that cause.	
				- Ex. tree swaying outside in the wind is caused by wind. The two are associated and one can cause the other, but we're usually sure it's the wind causing the swaying.
			- "Causal imputation" is imputation of missing observations
				- What does this mean? Knowing a cause lets you ask "what if xyz was done differently?" (construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes)
			- Causal inference is related to description (of population) and design (of project)
				- These all rely on some scientific model
- DAGs (Directic Acyclic Graphs)
	- Essentially highly abstracted causal models - the only info in a DAG are variables and one-way causal relationships.
	- All a DAG defines is relationships - no more, no less. Used to clarify thinking.
	- Analyze this to produce appropriate statistical models.
	- "What can we decide, without additional assumptions?"
	- See video's diagram:
		- X -> Y
		- C -> X, Y
		- A -> C, X
		- B -> C, Y
		- X, B are competing causes of Y
		- A influences the treatment
		- C is compounding influence of X and Y
	- Can ask multiple questions
		- What should be our control variables? DONT ADD EVERYTHING
		- How to test/refine causal model?
		- How do we escape from data and get into science?
