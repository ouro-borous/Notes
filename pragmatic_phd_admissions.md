## Intro
- There's a lot of advice on PhD apps online. Some of it is good, some is bad.
	- I'll try my best to give tips and tricks on what was actually helpful
- I'll denote parts that I felt were strong with ``(S)``.
- The general theme of the guide is "show, don't tell"
	- Throughout your materials, you're trying to show the admissions committee that you're normal and can be trusted with a fat stipend.
		- Do the math on what a PhD program is worth. For CMU, mine is worth ~120k per year. x5/6 years means this is a big commitment.
	- Which of these sounds more persuasive? Which demonstrates passion better?
		- "I am very passionate about cybersecurity."
		- "I did 4 cybersecurity projects over the past two years on my own."
	- You're trying to **tell your story** while also **demonstrating aptitude**
		- For me, I was trying to tell that I cared about open source, accessible security and privacy, influenced by my childhood experiences.
			- I tried to provide evidence to this through work and experiences, which also simultaneously demonstrated aptitude/passion.
- **IMPORTANT** TAKE THIS GUIDE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT **IMPORTANT**
	- I am most certainly NOT an admissions advisor. This is written without vision into the apparent black box of admissions.
	- Maybe I'll update this if I serve on adcom at some point in the future. 
- **IMPORTANT** READ THE WHOLE DOCUMENT **IMPORTANT**
	- I tried to make this as no-fluff as possible. Everything is in here for a reason.
	- OK, maybe a couple of the links can be skipped. But try not to!
## Pragmatic PhD Advice
- Choosing schools
	- This is misleading. You should choose professors that you want to work with.
	- Not all professors are looking for students, and not all schools have fantastic programs. Whittle your list down.
		- I applied to 4? schools. This felt a bit low. I would recommend applying to 8-9+ unless you have insane research fit.
	- Research + personality fit with your future PI is *monstrously* important.
		- ``(S)`` For me, DDM at Carnegie Mellon is pretty much the only lab in the country that does deception + cyber psychology work
			- I certainly made it a point to bring this up in my SOP. No harm in saying this outright. 
- Statement of purpose (SOP)
	- I pretty much already said the big things in the intro section.
	- The goal of the SOP is to tell a more personal story. Try to capture YOUR essence.
		- In other words - this is NOT a resume. 
			- Keep the citations minimal and try to talk more about:
				- *Why* you did xyz
				- *What* general philosophy did you follow while doing xyz?
				- *How* you felt after doing xyz or at some other abc time.
		- Other people say this frequently in PhD tips. I agree with this advice.
	- My SOP followed this general structure
		- **Intro**
			- Keep it simple, stupid.
			- Add a hook. Short and simple.
				- "Perception shapes reality. This is the fundamental tenet of cyber deception, a defensive practice focused on prompting, identifying, and exposing behaviors characteristic of covert cybercriminals by simulating infrastructure and information within a computer network. "
				- Now that I look back, this was probably a bit wordy. 
				- ``(S)`` Finding the correct balance of descriptive and straightforward is the challenge in writing a good SOP. 
			- General statement
				- ``(S)`` "I seek to continue my research in cyber deception through a PhD program in Societal Computing at CMU, working alongside experts in the ever-changing field of cybersecurity to make the world more safe and free."
				- I felt this was a really good intro. Talks about intent, long term goals, and means to achieve this (all at a high level.)
			- This was my entire intro. Three sentences. Again, this should be really concise.
		- **Competitions**
			- Here, I talked about CTFs, CCDC, and VIVID. Touched on the combination of offensive and defensive experience.
			- Again, try to tell a story while demonstrating your aptitude.
				- ``(S)`` This section was about competitions, but I discussed how they made me curious in the blending of offensive and defensive techniques.
		- **Independent Research**
			- I use the term "research" pretty liberally here. This was where I talked about RSA and another personal project ("RAD").
			- This was the section that felt the most like a CV while writing. Kind of problematic, but it was necessary for a contiguous story.
		- **Open Source Development**
			- This section, I discussed some long term goals (open source development) and used another personal project as evidence, which built on RSA and RAD.
			- ``(S)`` Weaving together previous sections felt really good when writing.
				- Writing chronologically made discussing my motivations and reasoning much easier.
			- ``(S)`` This was a good case of combining past experiences with personal values/motivations.
		- **Motivations**
			- Here, talk about what motivates you. Good place to talk about personal obstacles in your education.
			- Try to discuss how your lived life has shaped your current motivations!
		- **Goals**
			- Straightforward. Talk about what you want to do in the future and **why a PhD specifically is important for this**
			- This section should be supported by all previous sections. You shouldn't need to do any justifying here - just state what you want clearly.
			- This section is different from Motivations. Motivs discusses general guiding values you have, while Goals discusses specific things you want to do or be **in accordance with your motivations**
		- **Professors of Interest**
			- Talk about professors of interest, their research, and ideas you may have.
				- Assume that these professors of interest are going to read your SOP. Try to make insightful comments.
			- This part should honestly be easy, **if** you've already done your research when choosing schools to apply to. 
		- **Conclusion**
			- At this point, you should have said everything that needs to be said. Use this as a place to be respectful and leave the SOP on a good note.
			- "The opportunities and community that Carnegie Mellon provides are unmatched, and I hope to use such liberties to their fullest extent. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to speaking with you soon."
- Letters of rec.
	- Here are the people I would recommend asking:
		- Professors that you've performed well with **and demonstrated extra effort/interest.**
			- I asked the advisor for my cybersecurity club, Dr. Brent Lagesse. He knew about our performance in competitions and my interest in cyber deception.
		- Professionals that know you well and can speak on your abilities, motivations, and trustworthiness.
			- I asked the other advisor of my club, Jesse Moore, who runs UW IT.
			- I also asked Tim Pappa, a former FBI agent that I met at RSA and did a project with.
		- Note: Some guides online recommend to only ask for LORs from professors. 
			- I personally disagree. They can be professionals. But they need to be **relevant, respected, and good at what they do.**
	- Ask early. The earlier the better, to be honest.
		- Professors can write letters anytime, but submission is within a certain window of time. Don't forget this! 
			- Professors may need to personalize letters on a per school basis. 
		- Ask them to submit the letters 3 weeks before the submission deadline for each school. Minimum 2 weeks, but try to make it 3.
	- Have your recommenders read this link. You should also read it, too. It helps frame your mindset of an LOR.

- CV writing
	- Writing your CV in LaTeX makes it feel more professional. Here's the template I used.
		- ``https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/academic-cv-template/gmyytjmdbvdm``
		- This is ultimately personal preference.
		- I tried to stay away from templates with flashy colors or formatting. 
			- Clean, concise, formal is the name of the game.
			- Your text content should be the interesting part! So make it easdy to read.
	- ``(S)`` Highlight the mix of experience and performance that makes you YOU! Be unique! Don't feel pressured to fit the experiences of others!
		- Here are the categories I wrote, in the order they populated the CV.
			- Education
				- Degree, GPA, duration 
			- Research Experience
				- "Research" can be pretty broad. This doesn't need to be work with a lab or a professor
					- ``(S)`` Essentially all of my "research" experience was me just exploring something on my own in a structured manner
				- I'd recommend talking about personal projects here.
					- *But make sure that you're trying to do something new!*
			- Competition Experience
				- For cybersec in particular, this is really valuable.
				- ``(S)`` Doing decently well in both offensive and defensive competitions shows that your'e well rounded 
			- Industry Experience
			- Leadership and Service
			- Awards and Sponsorship
			- Other
